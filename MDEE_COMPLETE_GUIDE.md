## 1. What the robot is
A pet-style robot: it talks and answers real questions using an AI, shows an animated face, moves its ears and neck, drives on 4 wheels,
avoids obstacles, wanders or follows things, shows lights, and can be driven from your phone. Music playback is possible through a self-hosted XiaoZhi server (section 12).

It uses **two boards** that talk over 3 wires:

```
 BRAIN  ESP32-S3 N16R8  ("XiaoZhi" AI firmware + our board "mdee-robot")
   microphone, speaker, face screen, OLED, Wi-Fi, AI voice, phone web page, logic-battery meter
        |  UART 115200 (TX, RX, GND)
 BODY   ESP32-S3 Super Mini  (our own firmware in folder mdee_body)
   4 motors (TB6612), 2 distance sensors, 3 servos, 2 NeoPixels, 8 white LEDs, motor-battery meter, obstacle safety,
   wander/follow, ear behaviour
```
Why two boards: there were not enough pins on one. Bonus: the body keeps the robot safe even if the brain is busy or crashes.

The AI part (hearing you, understanding, answering, speaking) runs on the **XiaoZhi cloud service (xiaozhi.me)**, not inside the robot.
So the robot needs **Wi-Fi and internet** for talking. Driving from the phone page and the safety/autonomy work without internet
(the phone and the robot must be on the same Wi-Fi).

---

## 2. Music and radio (what exists and what does not)
* **No FM radio.** Real FM (88-108 MHz, works without internet) needs an FM receiver chip such as the RDA5807M, an antenna and an analog amplifier, plus code that does not exist. It is **not** in this project.
* **No internet-link audio player.** I built one earlier and **removed it** because it was confusing.
* **Music = the official XiaoZhi "local music library".** It is a feature of the **self-hosted XiaoZhi server** (`play_music` plugin): you put MP3 files in a folder on the server computer, say "play <song name>",
  and the server streams the song to the robot's speaker. The robot firmware contains no music player. Details, setup and the one-time rebuild are in **LOCAL_MUSIC_GUIDE.md** and section 12.
* Without your own server (using the free xiaozhi.me cloud) the robot talks, answers and moves, but I cannot promise a local music library there.

---

## 4. Wiring
**Golden rules**
* Every ground is joined: both packs −, boost, buck, TB6612, both ESP boards, all sensors.
* Never connect 5 V to an ESP32 GPIO. All signals into the ESP boards must be 3.3 V.
* Motors and servos get their own power; do not power them from the ESP boards' 3.3 V pin.
* Logic parts at **3.3 V**: INMP441, OLED, ST7789, PCF8574, TB6612 logic (VCC). At **5 V**: MAX98357A, HC-SR04, NeoPixels, servos.

### 4.1 Brain (ESP32-S3 N16R8) – pins
| Part | Part pin | Brain GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| INMP441 mic | SCK | **4** |
| | WS | **5** |
| | SD | **6** |
| | L/R, GND | GND |
| | VDD | 3.3 V |
| MAX98357A amp | BCLK | **4** (shared with mic) |
| | LRC | **5** (shared with mic) |
| | DIN | **7** |
| | VIN | 5 V |
| | GND | GND |
| | speaker | to + and − |
| ST7789 face | SCL/CLK | **12** |
| | SDA/MOSI | **11** |
| | CS | **10** |
| | DC | **9** |
| | RES | **8** |
| | BLK (backlight) | 3.3 V |
| | VCC, GND | 3.3 V, GND |
| OLED 0.96" | SDA | **17** |
| | SCL | **18** |
| | VCC, GND | 3.3 V, GND (address 0x3C) |
| LED bar (8 white LEDs) | LED 1-4 (LEFT) | **13, 14, 21, 38** |
| | LED 5-8 (RIGHT) | **39, 40, 41, 42** |
| | each LED | GPIO → 330 Ω → LED anode, cathode → GND |
| Link to body | brain TX | **15** → body RX label (GPIO44) |
| | brain RX | **16** ← body TX label (GPIO43) |
| Logic-battery meter | divider middle | **1** (see section 5) |
| BOOT button | built-in | GPIO0 |

Do not use GPIO 26-37 on the N16R8 (flash/PSRAM) and avoid 0, 19, 20, 45, 46.

### 4.2 Body (ESP32-S3 Super Mini) – pins
(Super Mini boards differ slightly: check your board has these pins; if not, change `mdee_body/body_config.h`.)
| Part | Part pin | Body GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| TB6612 | STBY | **4** (and 10 kΩ from STBY to GND) |
| | AIN1 / AIN2 / PWMA | **5 / 6 / 7** |
| | BIN1 / BIN2 / PWMB | **8 / 9 / 10** |
| | VCC (logic) | 3.3 V |
| | VM | 12 V motor pack (after fuse and switch) |
| | A01/A02 | the two **left** motors (in parallel) |
| | B01/B02 | the two **right** motors (in parallel) |
| HC-SR04 (both) | VCC / GND | 5 V / GND |
| | TRIG (both joined) | **11** |
| | front ECHO | **12** via divider (4.3) |
| | rear ECHO | **3** via divider |
| Servo neck **turn** | signal | **13** |
| Servo neck **tilt** | signal | **15** |
| Servo **ears** | signal | **16** |
| (all servos) | power | separate 5 V buck, + 1000 µF |
| NeoPixel ×2 (chained) | DIN | **2** via 330 Ω |
| | VCC / GND | 5 V / GND |
| PCF8574 (**optional**, only if `LED_BAR_ON_BRAIN` is set to 0) | SDA / SCL | **17 / 18** (address 0x20) |
| Motor-battery meter | divider middle | **1** (see section 5) |
| Link to brain | body TX label (GPIO43) | → brain GPIO16 |
| | body RX label (GPIO44) | ← brain GPIO15 |

Test the motors: if a wheel side drives backwards when told "forward", change `MOTOR_LEFT_INVERT` or `MOTOR_RIGHT_INVERT` to `true` in `mdee_body/body_config.h`.
One TB6612 channel gives 1.2 A continuous (about 3 A peak). Two small motors per side are fine; if they stall hard, use a second driver.

### 4.3 Ultrasonic ECHO dividers (important)
The HC-SR04 echo pin outputs **5 V**, but the ESP32 accepts only 3.3 V.
```
 ECHO ──[1 kΩ]──┬── ESP32 GPIO (12 or 3)
                │
              [2 kΩ]
                │
               GND
```
Result: 5 V × 2/3 = 3.33 V. Do this for both sensors.

### 4.4 The 8 white LEDs (no PCF8574 needed)
The LEDs connect **straight to the brain** (the N16R8 has spare pins). For each of the 8 LEDs:
```
 brain GPIO ──[330 Ω]──►|──── GND        (resistor to the LED's long leg/anode; short leg/cathode to GND)
```
| LED | Side | Brain GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | left | 13 |
| 2 | left | 14 |
| 3 | left | 21 |
| 4 | left | 38 |
| 5 | right | 39 |
| 6 | right | 40 |
| 7 | right | 41 |
| 8 | right | 42 |

LEDs 1-4 = left and 5-8 = right are used by the turn signals. Put them left-to-right along the front bar in that order (the "battery" pattern lights LED 1 first).
Each LED draws about 4 mA. If a GPIO number does not exist on your board, change `LED_BAR_PIN0..7` in `main/boards/mdee-robot/config.h`.

*Later option:* if you buy a PCF8574, wire the LEDs to it (3.3 V → 330 Ω → LED → PCF8574 pin P0..P7, active low, body GPIO17/18), set `LED_BAR_ON_BRAIN 0` in `config.h`, and rebuild. The body firmware already supports it. Without a PCF8574 the body only prints a harmless "PCF8574 not found" warning.

### 4.5 Power layout
```
 12 V pack (3 × Li-ion in series + 3S BMS)
      │ fuse + switch
      ├──────────────► TB6612 VM and the 4 motors (+470 µF)

      └──► 5 V buck (≥3 A) ──► servos only (+1000 µF)

      └──► 5 V boost (≥3 A) ──► brain, body, amp, HC-SR04 ×2, NeoPixels
                                 (+1000 µF; the boards make their own 3.3 V)

 ALL grounds (both packs −, boost, buck, TB6612, both boards) joined together.
```
Typical logic draw is about 0.5-1.5 A at 5 V (Wi-Fi + amp + LCD + lights), which is why a ≥ 3 A boost module is advised.

---

## 5. Voltage dividers
### 5.1 Motor pack (12 V, 3S) → body GPIO1
```
 Pack + (after fuse) ──[R1 100 kΩ]──┬──────► body GPIO1
                                    ├──[R2 22 kΩ]──► GND
                                    ├──[100 nF]────► GND
                                    └──[3.3 V Zener, optional]──► GND (cathode on the node)
```
* Ratio = 22 ÷ 122 = **0.1803**. The code multiplies the pin voltage by **5.545**.
* Constants: `BATTERY_R_UPPER_OHM = 100000`, `BATTERY_R_LOWER_OHM = 22000` in `mdee_body/body_config.h`.
* 0 % = 9.6 V, 100 % = 12.6 V. Motors cut off if below about 9.3 V for 5 seconds.

| Pack | At the pin |
|---|---|
| 12.6 V (full) | 2.27 V |
| 11.1 V (nominal) | 2.00 V |
| 9.6 V (0 %) | 1.73 V |
| 13.0 V (charger overshoot) | 2.34 V |

The ADC reads safely up to about 3.1 V at the pin (a 17 V pack), so there is a large margin.

### 5.2 Logic pack (2 cells in parallel, 3.0-4.2 V) → brain GPIO1
```
 Battery + terminal ──[R1 100 kΩ]──┬──────► brain GPIO1
 (tap in front of the boost)       ├──[R2 100 kΩ]──► GND
                                   ├──[100 nF]──────► GND
                                   └──[3.3 V Zener, optional]──► GND
```
* Ratio = **0.5**; the code multiplies the pin voltage by **2.0**.
* Constants in `main/boards/mdee-robot/config.h`: `LOGIC_BAT_R_UPPER_OHM`, `LOGIC_BAT_R_LOWER_OHM`.
* 100 % = 4.20 V, 0 % = 3.30 V. Low warning ≤ 15 % for 5 s. Critical below 3.20 V for 5 s.

| Battery | At the pin |
|---|---|
| 4.20 V | 2.10 V |
| 3.70 V | 1.85 V |
| 3.30 V (0 %) | 1.65 V |
| 3.20 V (critical) | 1.60 V |

The reason for this meter: the boost converter always outputs 5 V until the cells are nearly empty, so the robot could not otherwise know.
If the divider is not wired, the OLED shows `L --.-V` and raises no alarm.

### 5.3 Calibrating (2 minutes, multimeter)
Measure the battery voltage `Vbat` and the voltage at the pin `Vpin`. Then set
`R_UPPER = R_LOWER × (Vbat ÷ Vpin − 1)` in the matching constant. This cancels resistor tolerance.

### 5.4 Safety of the dividers
If the lower resistor or a wire breaks, the pin would see the full battery voltage and could be destroyed. The optional 3.3 V Zener
on each pin prevents that. Use 1 % resistors if you can.

---

## 6. Power notes and battery protection
* **Never** connect the 12 V pack to a logic pin or the 5 V rail. Check polarity twice.
* Put a **fuse** and a **switch** on each pack. Use a **3S BMS** on the 12 V pack. Use a **protection board** on the 2-cell pack. Li-ion cells can catch fire if shorted or over-discharged.
* Charge with a charger made for your pack (3S balance charger; a 1S/2P Li-ion charger). Do not charge unattended.
* Switch on order: any order is fine, because the body stops motors until told to move. Switch **off** the motor pack when you work on the wiring.
* Battery alarms:

| Level | What the robot does |
|---|---|
| Logic pack ≤ 15 % (5 s) | Plays the low-battery sound once, OLED row shows blinking `!! LOGIC BATT LOW !!` |
| Logic pack < 3.2 V (5 s) | **Critical:** robot stops, ears droop, OLED shows `CHARGE NOW! STOPPED`, refuses driving and autonomy |
| Motor pack < 9.3 V (5 s) | Body cuts the motors (phone page shows "LOW – motors off"); talking still works |
| Ears droop while idle | Motor pack below about 10 % |

* USB-only testing: if the motor pack is not connected the OLED shows `M --.-V` and no motor-battery alarm is raised. The motors will not move without the 12 V pack.

---

## 7. Build the firmware on GitHub from your phone
The repo contains only your robot (two firmwares). GitHub builds both automatically.

Short version (full version with error table: **TERMUX_GUIDE.md**):
```
pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y git unzip nano curl
termux-setup-storage
cd ~
cp ~/storage/downloads/Bot2-mdee.zip .
unzip -o Bot2-mdee.zip
cd Bot2-main
ls -a
bash termux_push.sh "first upload"
```
Before that: make an empty GitHub repo and a **token** (classic, tick **repo** and **workflow**). When Git asks for a password, paste the token.
The script re-creates the hidden `.github/workflows/mdee.yml` and prints `OK` only when the workflow really is in the commit.

Then: GitHub → your repo → **Actions** → *Build M'DEE robot* → latest run → **Artifacts**:
* `mdee_brain_n16r8_…` → flash on the **N16R8**
* `mdee_body_supermini_…` → flash on the **Super Mini**

Each is a zip holding `merged-binary.bin`: a complete image to write at address **0x0**.

**Flashing without a PC:** I have not verified a phone-only flashing method. Options: an Android flasher app or browser tool that supports ESP32-S3 over a USB-OTG cable, or borrow a PC once and use any ESP flash tool (for example the "ESP Web Flasher" in Chrome, or `esptool.py write_flash 0x0 merged-binary.bin`).
Super Mini: hold BOOT while plugging in USB if it is not detected.

**Updating to a newer zip from me (no need to start again):** put the new `Bot2-mdee.zip` in Download, then
```
cd ~
cp ~/storage/downloads/Bot2-mdee.zip .
unzip -o Bot2-mdee.zip
cd Bot2-main
bash termux_push.sh "update"
```
`unzip -o` overwrites the changed files and keeps your Git history and token.

**Changing something later:** edit a file in Termux (`nano path/to/file`), then `bash termux_push.sh "what I changed"`, then download the new artifacts and flash again.

---

## 8. First start-up
1. Switch on both packs. The brain's face screen plays your **M'DEE boot logo animation** (about 4 seconds), then the animated face appears.
2. The OLED shows state text. **Wi-Fi setup (first time only):** the robot opens a hotspot named **Xiaozhi-XXXX**. Join it with your phone and open the address shown on the OLED (usually `192.168.4.1`), choose your home Wi-Fi and enter the password. The robot restarts and joins.
   To redo Wi-Fi later: click BOOT **while the robot is starting up** (right after power-on).
3. **Activation:** on first connection the robot gives a **6-digit code** (shown on the OLED and spoken). Go to **xiaozhi.me** on your phone browser, log in, add a device and enter the code. There you can also choose the AI model, voice and add extra tools.
4. Check the OLED: row 0 should show Wi-Fi bars and the mode, **not** `NO BODY LINK`. If it says `NO BODY LINK` see Troubleshooting.
5. Open the phone page: `http://<robot-ip>/` (the IP is shown on the OLED while idle, under "Phone control page"). Phone and robot must be on the same Wi-Fi.
6. Test with the robot lifted off the ground first: tap the joystick slowly and check the wheels spin the right way.

---

## 9. Using the robot
### 9.1 Talking (voice)
* **Say the wake word.** The firmware in this build uses the model `wn9_hijason_tts2` (meant to be "Hi, Jason"). If it does not react, **click the BOOT button** to start talking instead.
  You can change the wake word by changing `--wake-word` in `.github/workflows/mdee.yml` to another ESP-SR model name such as `wn9_hiesp`.
* Flow: say the wake word → ears perk up, NeoPixels **blue** (listening) → speak → robot answers with the mouth moving and NeoPixels **green pulse** → back to standby (NeoPixels **cyan pulse**). Purple pulse appears only while the robot is connecting to the server.
* Ask anything: questions, jokes, maths, news-style questions (depends on the AI model you choose on xiaozhi.me), "turn the volume up", "set the volume to 60".
* What you said and the robot's answer appear on the **OLED** (letters only; other alphabets show `?`).

### 9.2 Voice commands for the robot's body
The AI understands normal sentences and calls these tools for you:
| Say (examples) | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Move forward", "go forward fast", "back up slowly" | Drives. Speeds: **slow 35 %, medium 55 %, fast 75 %, turbo (high speed) 95 %** |
| "Turn left", "spin right", "turn around" | Turns on the spot (about 0.5-0.7 s per quarter turn at medium; there is no gyro, so angles are approximate) |
| "Go forward for 3 seconds" | Duration from 0.1 to 10 s (default 1.5 s) |
| "Stop", "freeze", "halt" | Stops at once and goes to manual mode |
| "Wander around", "explore" | Autonomous roaming with obstacle avoidance |
| "Follow me" (a hand or person in front) | Follow mode (see section 11) |
| "Stay", "manual mode" | Autonomy off |
| "Look left/right/up/down", "look at me" | Neck turn/tilt (angles 0-180, 90 = straight) |
| "Wiggle your ears", "ears up", "ears down", "flick your ears" | Ear gestures |
| "Turn on the lights", "chase lights", "blink", "left signal", "battery lights" | White LED bar patterns |
| "Make your eyes red", "rainbow lights", "breathing blue light" | NeoPixel colours/effects |
| "Dance" | About 4 s: spinning left/right, head moves, ear wiggle, rainbow lights |
| "How is your battery?", "What is in front of you?", "Are you ok?" | Reads status (both batteries, distances, mode, wheel speeds) |
| "Play <song name>", "stop the music" | Local music library on your own XiaoZhi server (section 12) |
| "Set volume to 50" | Speaker volume (built-in XiaoZhi tool) |

The AI sometimes needs a repeat if it did not understand. Speak clearly, near the microphone.

### 9.3 Buttons
| Action on BOOT (GPIO0) button | Result |
|---|---|
| Single click otherwise | Starts/stops talking (same as the wake word) |
| Single click during start-up | Enters Wi-Fi setup mode |
| **Double click** | **Emergency stop** (drives stop, manual mode) |

### 9.4 The phone page
Open `http://<robot-ip>/` on the same Wi-Fi. Optional PIN: add `#define WEB_CONTROL_PIN "1234"` in `config.h`, then open `http://<ip>/?k=1234`.
| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| Status box | Mode, motor pack V/%, logic pack V/%, front/rear distance in cm, LOW warnings |
| **Slow / Medium / Fast / Turbo** | Sets how strong the joystick drives (35/55/75/95 %) |
| **Joystick** | Hold and drag to drive and steer. **Lifting your finger stops the robot.** The robot also stops by itself 0.45 s after the last command (lost Wi-Fi, locked phone) |
| **STOP** | Stops immediately |
| **Manual / Wander / Follow** | Autonomy mode |
| Neck turn / Neck tilt sliders | Neck servos (0-180) |
| **Ears up / Ears down / Wiggle / Auto** | Ear gestures (Auto = natural idle flicks) |
| Light buttons: Off / On / Chase / Blink / Battery | White LED bar |
| Rainbow / Breathe / Red / Green / Blue | NeoPixels |

Anything you do manually (joystick, STOP) cancels autonomy modes.

## 10. Everything the robot does and what it means
### 10.1 Face (ST7789)
| What you see | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Boot logo animation (~4 s) | Starting up |
| Blinking eyes, eyes glancing around | Awake and idle (blink every 2-6 s) |
| Mouth moving | The robot is speaking (mouth moves only while it speaks) |
| **Neutral** (cyan eyes, soft smile) | Normal |
| **Happy / laughing / funny / winking / silly** | Bigger smile; laughing narrows the eyes and opens the mouth; winking closes one eye |

| Ears **perk up** | Listening to you; also surprised / thinking / confused |
| Ears **wiggle** | Happy, laughing, loving, funny, silly, winking, dancing |
| Ears **droop back** | Sad, crying, sleepy, angry, embarrassed; logic battery critical; motor battery below ~10 % |
| Occasional small **flick** (every 5-12 s) | Idle "pet" life |
| Relaxed in the middle | Normal / waiting |

### 10.3 NeoPixels (2 colour lights)
| Colour | Meaning |

| **Blink** | All blink |
| **Left / Right** | Turn signal: left four or right four blink |
| **Battery** | Bar of lit LEDs = motor-pack charge (8 lit = full). One LED blinking = no motor-battery reading (12 V pack off or body not connected) |

### 10.5 The OLED (128 × 64), rows from the top
| Row | Content |
|---|---|
| 1 | `WiFi ||||` (bars = signal strength) and the mode (`manual`, `wander`, `follow`). Shows `NO BODY LINK` if the body board is not answering |
| 2 | `M12.1V 87% L3.9V 72%` – **M** = motor pack, **L** = logic pack. `--.-V` means not connected/not measured |
| 3 | Distances `Front 123  Rear 45` in cm (`--` = nothing seen / too far). Replaced by a blinking `!! LOGIC BATT LOW !!` or `CHARGE NOW! STOPPED` when the logic battery is low/critical |
| 4 | Assistant state (Listening, Speaking, Standby, Connecting, ...) |
| 5-8 | What you said (`You: ...`) and the answer (`M'DEE: ...`). When idle: "Phone control page: http://IP" |

### 10.6 Sounds
The robot speaks answers, plays the system prompts (Wi-Fi/activation messages), a one-time **low-battery sound** for the logic pack, and music streamed by your own XiaoZhi server (if you set that up).
There are no beeps for obstacles.

### 10.7 Movement and what it means
| Movement | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Soft start/stop | Acceleration is ramped (about 0.25 s) to protect gears |
| Slows down | Something is within 40 cm in the direction of travel |
| Stops by itself | Something is within 18 cm in the direction of travel (front when going forward, rear when reversing) |
| Spins on the spot | Turn command; allowed even near obstacles, so keep space around the body |
| Stops after ~0.45 s with no commands | Safety timer (phone lost, finger lifted) |
| Head fidgets a little when idle | Natural idle life (turn ±30°, tilt ±10° every 7-16 s) |
| Won't move, ears droop | Logic battery critical |

## 11. Autonomy and safety
**Wander** (medium speed): drives forward. When something is closer than about 24 cm, it backs up if the rear is clear (about 0.45 s, longer if stuck 3 times in 6 s), then turns a random way for about 0.45-1.1 s and goes on. It uses the front and rear distance sensors only (no camera), so it can miss thin things (chair legs, cables) or soft/angled surfaces that do not reflect ultrasound.

**Follow:** keeps about 30 cm from whatever is in front. Moves forward if the object is 40-90 cm away, reverses slowly if closer than 22 cm, stands still in between or if nothing is within 90 cm. It follows "the nearest thing ahead", not a specific person.

**Safety layers**
1. Body firmware stops forward driving at 18 cm and reverse driving at 18 cm (rear sensor).
2. Motors have a deadman timer: no new command for 0.45 s = stop.
3. If the brain goes silent for 5 s while autonomy is on, the body drops to manual and stops.
4. Low motor battery cuts the motors; critical logic battery stops the robot.
5. STBY is held low by a resistor, so motors are off while the body boots.
6. Double-click BOOT or tap STOP at any time.

## 12. Music: the XiaoZhi local library (server side)
(Full guide: **LOCAL_MUSIC_GUIDE.md**.)

**How it works:** the XiaoZhi **server** (self-hosted `xiaozhi-esp32-server`) has a `play_music` plugin. You put your MP3 files in its `music_dir` folder. When you say
"play <song name>", the server finds the best-matching file name and streams the song to the robot, which plays it on its speaker (the robot behaves as if speaking: mouth moves, green NeoPixels).

**You need:** a computer that stays on and is on the same Wi-Fi as the robot (PC, mini PC, Raspberry Pi or a small rented server), running the XiaoZhi server with `play_music` enabled and some MP3s in `music_dir`.
I have not tested running the server in Termux; I would not rely on it.

**One-time robot rebuild to use your server:** add `"CONFIG_OTA_URL=\"http://<server-ip>:8003/xiaozhi/ota/\"",` to the `sdkconfig_append` list in `main/boards/mdee-robot/config.json`,
push with `bash termux_push.sh "use my own server"`, download the new brain artifact and flash it. Removing the line returns the robot to xiaozhi.me.

**Voice:** "Play lofi beats", "play some music", "stop the music" (or say the wake word / click BOOT).

**There is no music control on the robot's phone page or buttons**: music is controlled by voice through the server.

## 14. Troubleshooting
### Build and GitHub
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `.github` missing on GitHub | Use `bash termux_push.sh`; or create `.github/workflows/mdee.yml` in the GitHub app and paste `workflow_backup/mdee.yml` |
| Push says "refusing ... workflow" | Token lacks the **workflow** scope: make a new token (repo + workflow) |
| "Authentication failed" | You typed your password; paste the token |
| No Actions runs | Repo → Settings → Actions → allow actions; branch must be `main`; use **Run workflow** |
| Red build | Open the failed step and send me the first error lines |
| Artifact is empty | Both jobs must be green; download from the finished run |

### Power and start-up
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Nothing lights up | Check the logic switch, fuse, boost output (5 V), polarity |
| Robot reboots when motors/servos move | Servos on their own 5 V buck; add 1000 µF; common ground; thicker wires; check boost ≥ 3 A |
| OLED blank | Wires on 17/18, address 0x3C, 3.3 V; OLED shares the I2C lines only with nothing else on the brain |
| Face screen white/black/garbled | Check SPI wires, backlight to 3.3 V, power |
| Face rotated, mirrored, shifted or colours inverted | Edit `DISPLAY_*` in `config.h` |
| Boot logo shows then screen stays black | Tell me; likely a screen setting or the GIF feature |

### Wi-Fi, phone and AI
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No hotspot `Xiaozhi-XXXX` | Press BOOT during start-up; reflash if needed |
| Can't open the phone page | Same Wi-Fi? Use the IP on the OLED (not `.local`); some phones block "http" – type `http://` fully; try again after 20 s |
| Phone page says offline | Wi-Fi lost; check the robot's signal bars |
| Robot hears nothing | Mic wires (4/5/6), 3.3 V, L/R pin to GND, hole not blocked; click BOOT to talk instead of the wake word |
| Wake word never works | Use the BOOT button; try `wn9_hiesp` in the workflow; keep speaker volume low |
| Robot speaks but no sound | Amp wiring 4/5/7, 5 V on the amp, speaker connected, volume ("set volume to 70") |
| Distorted or crackling sound | Weak 5 V rail/boost; add capacitor; lower volume |
| AI doesn't do actions | Ask clearly ("move forward slowly for two seconds"); tools are registered at start-up, check the OLED shows no `NO BODY LINK` |
| "Not activated" / no answers | Finish activation on xiaozhi.me with the 6-digit code; check internet |

### Body link and motion
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| OLED shows `NO BODY LINK` | Cross the wires: brain 15 → body RX(44), brain 16 ← body TX(43); join GND; body firmware flashed; body powered |
| Motors don't move | 12 V pack on, TB6612 VM wired, STBY wired to GPIO4, motor-battery not below cutoff, front/rear obstacle closer than 18 cm in that direction, logic battery critical |
| Wrong direction | Invert flags (section 13) |
| Robot only turns one way / one side dead | One motor channel wiring (A01/A02, B01/B02), or driver overheating |
| Stops for no reason | An ultrasonic reads something close (floor too near, a wire in front of the sensor); view the distances on the OLED |
| Distances always `--` | Check the 5 V, TRIG (11), ECHO dividers (12 and 3), sensors facing out |
| Distances jump around | Add a 100 nF across 5 V near the sensors; soft or angled surfaces reflect poorly |
| Servo jitters or hums | Own 5 V rail + capacitor; do not drive past its stops (adjust `EAR_*` angles / limit sliders) |
| Ears move the wrong way | `EAR_INVERT true` or swap `EAR_PERK` and `EAR_DROOP` |
| Head looks the wrong way | Turn the horn 180° or edit the servo angle in your design |
| NeoPixels flicker/wrong colours | 330 Ω in the data line, short wire, 5 V supply, add a level shifter (e.g. 74AHCT125) if needed |
| White LEDs dark/never on | Check the 330 Ω resistor, the LED direction (long leg towards the resistor side) and the GPIO numbers in 4.4. Test with the phone page "On" button. (If you use a PCF8574: address 0x20, set `LED_BAR_ON_BRAIN 0`, LED anode to 3.3 V through the resistor, cathode to the pin, A0-A2 to GND) |
| Battery % wrong | Calibrate the divider (section 5.3) |

### Music
See the table in `LOCAL_MUSIC_GUIDE.md` (server not reachable, `play_music` not enabled, empty or wrong `music_dir`, wrong file names).

## 15. Limits and ideas for later
* **Not included:** FM radio, video playback, camera, gesture recognition, Bluetooth control (the S3 has BLE only and it is used for Wi-Fi setup), internet-link audio player (removed), YouTube/Spotify, sound-direction ("come to my voice").
* **Possible next steps:** the second microphone could give rough sound direction (it would let the robot turn toward you); a camera-capable board; an IMU for exact turn angles; an FM module (RDA5807M) with analog amp.
* No echo cancellation, so very loud music can hide the wake word; click BOOT to talk.
* Follow/wander use ultrasonic only; they cannot see thin objects or cliffs/stairs. **Do not run the robot near stairs or table edges unattended.**
* The code has never been compiled or tested on real hardware (see the note at the top).
